A Web Scraper built with beautiful soup, that fetches udemy course information.

> ## ðŸ“Œ New in 0.8.0
>
>### Added
>-  #### **Udemyscraper** can now export multiple courses to csv files!
>     - `course_to_csv` takes an array as an input and dumps each course to a single csv file.
>-  #### **Udemyscraper** can now export courses to xml files!
>     - `course_to_xml` is function that can be used to export the course object to an xml file with the appropriate tags and format.
>- `udemyscraper.export` submodule for exporting scraped course.
>- Support for Microsoft Edge (Chromium Based) browser.
>- Support for Brave Browser.
>
>### Changes
>- #### **Udemyscraper.py** has been refractured into 5 different files:
>     - `__init__.py` - Contains the code which will run when imported as a library
>     - `metadata.py` - Contains metadata of the package such as the name, version, author, etc. Used by setup.py
>     - `output.py`   - Contains functions for outputting the course information.
>     - `udscraperscript.py` -Is the script file which will run when you want to use udemyscraper as a script.
>     - `utils.py` - Contains utility related functions for udemyscraper.
>- #### Now using udemyscraper.export instead of udemyscraper.output.
>     - `quick_display` function has been replaced with `print_course` function.
>  
>
>- #### Now using `setup.py` instead of `setup.cfg`
>- #### Deleted `src` folder which is now replaced by `udemyscraper` folder which is the source directory for all the modules
>- ### **Installation Process**
>    #### Since udemyscraper is now to be used as a package, it is obvious that the installation process has also had major changes.
>   Installation process is documented [here](readme.md/#Installation) 
>
>- Renamed the `browser_preference` key in Preferences dictionary to `browser`
>- Relocated browser determination to `utils` as `set_browser` function.
>  
>### Fixed
>- Fixed cache argument bug.
>- Fixed importing preferences bug.
>- Fixed Banner Image scraping.
>- Fixed Progressbar exception handling.
>- Fixed recognition of chrome as a valid browser.
>- Preferences will not be printed while using the script.

# Usage

This section shows the basic usage of this script. Before this be sure to [install](#installation) this first before importing it in your file.

## As a Module

Udemyscraper contains a `UdemyCourse` class which can be imported into your file it takes just one argument which is `query` which is the seach query. It has a method called `fetch_course` which you can call after creating a UdemyCourse object.

```py
from udemyscraper import UdemyCourse

course = UdemyCourse('learn javascript')
course.fetch_course()
```

## As a Script

In case you do not wish to use the module in your own python file but you just need to dump the data, udemyscraper can be directly invoked along with a variety of arguments and options.

You can do so by running the udemyscraper. There is no need to worry about your `PATH` as it is automatically configured by pip on installation.

```bash
udemyscraper
```

Here is an example of dumping the data as a json file.

```bash
udemyscraper -d json -q "German course for beginners"
```

### List of Commands

![Commands](docs/command.svg)

# Installation

## Virtual Environment

Before installing the dependencies it is recommended to setup a virtual environment.

<details>

You can setup a virtual environment on your machine by using the `virtualenv` library and then activating it.

```bash
pip install virtualenv

virtualenv somerandomname

```

Activating for \*nix

```bash
source somerandomname/bin/activate
```

Activating for Windows

```
somerandomname\Scripts\activate
```

</details>

## Dependencies Installation

You are required to install all of the modules listed in `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ### Deprecated as of 0.8.0
> 

# Browser Setup

A browser window may not pop-up as I have enabled the `headless` option so the entire process takes minimal resources.

This script works with firefox as well as chrome.

## Chrome (or chromium)

To run this script you need to have chrom(ium) installed on the machine as well as the chromedriver binary which can be downloaded from this [page](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Make sure that the binary you have installed works on your platform/ architecture and the the driver version corresponds to the version of the browser you have downloaded.

I have already provided a windows binary of the driver in the repo itself which supports chrom(ium) 92. You can use that or you can get your specific driver from the link above.

To set chrome as default you can pass in an argument while initializing the class though it is set to chrome by default.

```py
mycourse = UdemyCourse(browser_preference="CHROME")
```

Or you can pass in a argument while using as a script

```bash
python3 udemyscraper.py -b chrome
```

## Firefox

In order to run this script this firefox, you need to have firefox installed as well as the `gekodriver` executable file in this directory or in your path.
You can download the gekodriver from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). Or use the one provided with the source code.

To use firefox instead of chrome, you can pass in an argument while initializing the class:

```py
mycourse = UdemyCourse(browser_preference="FIREFOX")
```

Or you can pass in a argument while using `udemyscraper.py`

```bash
python3 udemyscraper.py -b firefox
```

## Suppressing Browser

| **Headless Disabled**                 | **Headless Enabled**                   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ![Headless disabled](docs/header.gif) | ![Headless enabled](docs/headless.gif) |
| 19 Seconds                            | 12 Seconds                             |

In the above comparison you can clearly see that the image on the right (headless) completed way faster than the one with headless disabled. By suppressing the browser not only do you save time, but you also save system resources.

The `headless` option is enabled by default. But in case you want to disable it for debugging purposes, you may do so by passing the `headless` argument to `false`

```py
mycourse = UdemyCourse(headless=False)
```

Or specify the same for `udemyscraper.py`

```bash
python3 udemyscraper.py -h false
```

# Approach

It is fairly easy to webscrape sites, however, there are some sites that are not that scrape-friendly. Scraping sites, in itself is perfectly legal however there have been cases of lawsuits against web scraping, some companies \*cough Amazon \*cough consider web-scraping from its website illegal however, they themselves, web-scrape from other websites. And then there are some sites like udemy, that try to prevent people from scraping their site.

Using BS4 in itself, doesn't give the required results back, so I had to use a browser engine by using selenium to fetch the courses information. Initially, even that didn't work out, but then I realised the courses were being fetch asynchronously so I had to add a bit of delay. So fetching the data can be a bit slow initially.

## Why not just use the Udemy's API?

Even I thought of that after some digging around as I did not know that such an API existed. However, this requires you to have a udemy account already. I might add the use of this Api in the future, but right now, I would like to keep things simple. Moreover, this kind of front-end webscraping does not require authentication.

# Data

The following datatable contains all of the data that can be fetched.

## Course Class

This is the data of the parent class which is the course class itself.

# Output/ Dumping data

## Quick Display

When executing the file as a script, this is the default output mode and perhaps the most breif one.

<details>

```bash
(env) F:\Github\udemy-web-scraper> python udemyscraper.py -q "Learn Python" --quiet -n
===================== Fetched Course =====================

Learn Python Programming Masterclass

This Python For Beginners Course Teaches You The Python
Language Fast. Includes Python Online Training With Python 3

URL: https://udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/
Instructed by Tim Buchalka
4.5 out of 5 (79,526)
Duration: 64h 33m
469 Lessons and 25 Sections
```

The `quick_display` fucntion can also be called when using udemyscraper as a module.

```py
from udemyscraper import *

# Assuming you have already created a course object and fetched the data
quick_display(course)
```

</details>

## Converting to Dictionary

The entire course object is converted into a dictionary by using nested object to dictionary conversion iterations.

<details>

```py
from udemyscraper import course_to_dict
# Assuming you have already created a course object and fetched the data
dictionary_course = course_to_dict(course)
```

**Note** : This way of returning data does not work when evoked directly due to obvious reasons.

</details>

## Dumping as JSON

Currently, the script can convert the entire course into a dictionary, parse it into a json file and then dump it to a json file. You can do this by calling the `course_to_json()` function.

<details>

```py
from udemyscraper import course_to_json

# Assuming you have already created a course object and fetched the data
course_to_json(course)
```

This will dump the data to `object.json` file in the same directory. You can also specify the name of the file by passing in the corresponding argument

```py
course_to_json(course, 'course.json')
```

The object will now be stored on `course.json` file.

Here is an example of how the file will look like. (The file has been trunacted)
![output.json](docs/json.svg)

</details>

## Dumping as CSV

Currently not implemented yet.

## Dumping as XML

Currently in development. Kindly check out [Pull Request #21](https://github.com/sortedcord/udemy-web-scraper/pull/21) for more information and progress.

### For Jellyfin users

Jellyfin metadata uses XML structure for its `.nfo` files. For images, we only have one resource which is the poster of the file. It might be possible to write a custom XML structure for jellyfin. Currently in development.

# Contributing
